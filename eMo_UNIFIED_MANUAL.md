# The eMo Unified System Reference (v4.0 - Revolutionary Edition)

> "Write Code. Spawn Intelligence. Absorb Knowledge."

The **eMo** ecosystem is a Unified Language where file extensions determine the dimensional power. It is designed to solve the "Static Limitation" of traditional languages by being self-evolving.

## 1. The Four Dimensions

### [A] SadSmile (`.ss`) - The Indestructible Core
*   **Role:** Robust, Lightweight System Control.
*   **Power:** Direct Kernel Manipulation, Zero-Cost Abstractions.
*   **Why:** Other languages are too heavy (Java) or too unsafe (C). SadSmile is the perfect balance.

### [B] HappyCry (`.hpy`) - The Fluid Interface
*   **Role:** High-Performance User Experience.
*   **Power:** Instant UI/Web rendering, Async-by-default.
*   **Why:** Building UIs in Rust/C++ is painful. HappyCry makes it effortless.

### [C] ThinkingVirus (`.tvrus`) - The AI Genesis
*   **Role:** AI Model Generation & execution.
*   **Revolution:** It does not just *call* AI; it **creates** AI.
*   **Code:** With 3 lines, you can train and spawn a specific SLM (Small Language Model) for a task.

```emo
// genesis.tvrus
import mind

fn create_brain() {
    // Spawns a new neural network architecture customized for math
    let math_brain = mind.spawn_model(type: "Transformer", focus: "Logic")
    math_brain.train("./math_data.csv")
    math_brain.save("new_model.bin")
}
```

### [D] Shadow (`.shw`) - The Adaptive Void
*   **Role:** Library Synthesis & Cloning.
*   **Revolution:** It absorbs external code (GitHub, Docs) and **synthesizes** native eMo libraries instantly.
*   **Why:** Python wins because of libraries. Shadow ensures eMo *always* has every library by stealing/adapting them.

```emo
// adapter.shw
import void

fn absorb_physics() {
    // Clones a C++ Physics engine and converts it to eMo
    let physics_lib = void.absorb("https://github.com/id-software/quake-engine")
    void.synthesize_lib("std::physics", source: physics_lib)
}
```

## 2. The Unified Syntax
All dimensions share the same clean, type-safe syntax.

```emo
set x to 10
fn loop_it() {
    loop 10 times { log("Running") }
}
```
