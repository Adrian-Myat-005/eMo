# 💧 eMo: The Unified Intelligence System (v4.0)

> **"Write Code. Spawn Intelligence. Absorb Knowledge."**

eMo is a multi-dimensional programming ecosystem designed to collapse the distance between system logic, UI development, and AI generation. 

## 🚀 One-Line Installation

To install the entire eMo toolchain (SadSmile, HappyCry, and eMo Compiler) on any Linux, macOS, or WSL terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eMo/main/install_all.sh | bash
```

## 🏗️ The Four Dimensions

The eMo system determines its power by file extension, all sharing a unified, intuitive syntax.

| Extension | Component | Power |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.ss` | **SadSmile** | Indestructible System Core. Zero-cost abstractions. |
| `.hpy` | **HappyCry** | Fluid Automation & Web. Async-by-default. |
| `.tvrus`| **ThinkingVirus** | AI Genesis. Spawns and trains local SLMs. |
| `.shw` | **Shadow** | Adaptive Void. Absorbs and clones external libraries. |

## 🛠️ Usage Quickstart

Once installed, use these core commands:

### 1. Enter the Shell
```bash
ss
```
The SadSmile shell (`ss$`) provides a bash-like environment with integrated eMo tools.

### 2. Build a HappyCry App
```bash
happy build my_app.hpy
./my_app
```

### 3. Run an eMo Script
```bash
emo run script.emo
```
