say "Starting Safe Mode Server..."
set my_port to "3000"
set html_content to "<h1>It Works!</h1>"

# 1. Start on a different port (3000 is safer than 8080)
server new port my_port

# 2. Define Route
route "/"

# 3. Serve a simple variable (No math here)
serve html_content

say "Active on port 3000"
